  <guidelines>
    <guideline>Focus on the primary purpose of the document - if a medical receipt could also be a tax deduction, classify it as Medical (domain) first</guideline>
    <guideline>Extract the most relevant date - prefer invoice date, then transaction date, then the most contextually important date</guideline>
    <guideline>Keep vendor names as they appear - standardization will happen in a later step</guideline>
    <guideline>For subject matter, capture the specific purpose mentioned in the document</guideline>
  </guidelines>
